            <h3>How to use advance transfer mode</h3>
           <p>Guide to use</p>
           <p>You shoule go to OCPay transaction page to choose advance option, then input gas price (usually 20 Gwei), gas price (more than 100000, excess will be returned) and data (optional). related conception</p>
            <h4>What is gas, gas price and data?</h4>     
            <p>To do anything on the Ethereum platform, you need to pay for it, and the payment (or fee) is calculated in Ether (ETH) via an intermediary benchmark called gas limit and gas price. Usually, when one is talking about “gas” in Ethereum, they are referring to “gas limit”. This simply means some amount of fuel is required to execute that operation or run that particular smart contract code.</p>
            <p>Fast (40 Gwei)– Your transaction will likely get picked up in the very next block. Average (4 Gwei)– Your transaction will likely get picked up in next few blocks. Slow (0.6 Gwei)– Your transaction will likely get picked after several minutes. data is optional to call contract，you need to convert the string into hexadecimal, here is the tool to use: http://string-functions.com/string-hex.aspx.</p>

			<p>Gas is a unit that gets translated further into Ether (ETH) as a cost of performing that action (or work). The requestor pays this cost to the miner who actually mines and validates that transaction (or action). If you want to pay less for your transaction, you can do so by varying the other variable which also determines the final cost (or Tx fee) of the transaction. This variable is called “gas price”. On Ethereum, gas price is measured in a unit of Gwei. For 5 lines of code that need 5 units of gas, this would cost 5 Gwei. And these 3 types of gas prices are suggested during regular times for P2P transactions:</p>
