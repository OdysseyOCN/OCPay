        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
            <span>1. Create or import wallet. You may use OCPay to create a new wallet or import wallets generated by other wallet
                application. You may only import wallets with Tokens which are supported by OCPay.</span>

        </p>
        <p>
            <span>2. Transfer and receive Tokens. You may manage your digital Tokens by using the transfer and reception functionalities
                of OCPay, i.e., you may revise the blockchain ledger by signing with your Private Key. Transfer of Tokens
                means the payer transfer the Token to the blockchain address of the payee. The actual transfer of Tokens
                happens on the blockchain system (instead of on OCPay).</span>

        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
            <span>3. Observe the quotation. You may use OCPay to observe the quotation of the Tokens supported by OCPay. The quotation

                OCPay.</span>

        <p>

        <p>

        </p>

        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
            <span>1. In order to keep the decentralization feature of blockchain and to protect the security of your digital Tokens,
                ODYSSEY offers decentralized service which is largely different from the banking and financial institutions.

                Words, Private Key and Keystore by themselves. If your mobile device is lost, your OCPay App or your wallet
                is deleted and not backed up, your wallet is stolen or you forget your Wallet Password, Private Key, Mnemonic
                Words or Keystore, ODYSSEY is not able to recover the wallet or restore Wallet Password, Private Key, Mnemonic

                purpose of this Agreement, the word “transactions” only means transferring and receiving Tokens, which is

        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
            <span>5. The DApps integrated into OCPay include those developed independently by ODYSSEY and those developed by third
                parties. OCPay only acts as a blockchain browser for those third-party-developed DApps. Users shall, at their
                sole discretion, decide whether there would be any risks to accept the services provided by or to conduct
                transactions on the third-party-developed DApps.</span>

                certain services and the Specific Users alone shall be responsible for the loss caused by their delay in
                completing the verification.</span>
        </p>

            <span>1. You understand and acknowledge that the blockchain technology is a field of innovation where the laws and
                regulations are not fully established. You may be faced with material risks including instability of technology

                any of the above information.</span>
