        <h3> What is the “Gas” in Ethereum?</h3>


        <p>
            Gas is the execution fee for every operation made on ethereum. Its price is expressed in ether and is decided by the miners
            that can refuse to process the transaction with less than a certain gas price. To get gas you simply need to
            add ether to your account.
