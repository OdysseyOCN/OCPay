        <h4>Part 1: Definination:</h4>
        <p> Address: an address is essentially the representation of a public key belonging to a particular user; for example,
            the address associated with the private key given above is 0xE21Bde1c22637597B16E7444F911d2F3EC53B981. Note that
            in practice, the address is technically the hash of a public key, but for simplicity it's better to ignore this
            distinction. Transaction: a transaction is a digitally signed message authorizing some particular action associated
            with the blockchain. In a currency, the dominant transaction type is sending currency units or tokens to someone
            else; in other systems actions like registering domain names, making and fulfilling trade offers and entering
            into contracts are also valid transaction types.
        </p>
        <p> Mining: mining is the process of repeatedly aggregating transactions, constructing a block and trying different nonces
            until a nonce is found that satisfies the proof of work condition. If a miner gets lucky and produces a valid
            block, they are granted a certain number of coins as a reward as well as all of the transaction fees in the block,
            and all miners start trying to create a new block containing the hash of the newly generated block as their parent.
        </p>
        <p> Keystore: Encrypted version of your private key in JSON format (though it does not have a JSON extension). A fancy
            version of your private key that is protected by a password of your choosing. When combined with the password,
            it has the private key. Safer than a private key because you need the password. File name usually is in the format
            UTC + -- + DATE_CREATED + -- + YOUR_ADDRESS_WITHOUT_THE_OX Example of File Nae: UTC--2018-05-04T20-33-09.177Z--06a84285dcb5b138458957fb86b78c14d08e07ee.
            Example of Contents:
        </p>
        <p> {"version":3,"id":"aa811d53-fe9a-44a2-bd1c-e737007b5591","address":"06a84285dcb5b138458957fb86b78c14d08e07ee","Crypto":{"ciphertext":"f5a7cc1d4b2cf25810b0d0d0358f3a52ac79fd48e279e9873c4ffd248ca357848","cipherparams":{"iv":"155ab25862e2dd75820e91ca59c0b0bd"},"cipher":"aes-128-ctr","kdf":"scrypt","kdfparams":{"dklen":32,"salt":"0210f0d0b99e2580dfbceb33593325848bac093a367ee7da6411cd165f7aa907a","n":1024,"r":8,"p":1},"mac":"2567a747a3855a10546a2ff925c36470dbcd78e393b358efa0c12fe3b53dd7e3"}}
        </p>
        <p> Mnemonic Phrase: Another fancy version of your private key, that is actually used to derive multiple private keys.
            A (typically) 12 or 24 word phrase that allows you to access infinite number of accounts. Used by Ledger, TREZOR,
            MetaMask, Jaxx, and others. Originates from BIP 39 Spec. The accounts you can access with this phrase are determined
            by the "path". Example 12-words: brain surround have swap horror body response double fire dumb bring hazard.
        </p>
        <p> Decentralization:By storing data across its network, the blockchain eliminates the risks that come with data being
            held centrally. The decentralized blockchain may use ad-hoc message passing and distributed networking. Its network
            lacks centralized points of vulnerability that computer crackers can exploit; likewise, it has no central point
            of failure.
        </p>
        <p>Public Key: In cryptography, you have a keypair: the public and private key. You can derive a public key from a private
            key, but cannot derive a private key from a public key. (Advanced) In Ethereum, the address "acts" like the public
            key, but it's not actually the public key. (Advanced) In Ethereum, the public key is derived from the private
            key and is 128 hex characters. You then take the "SHA3" (Keccak-256) hash of this (64 characters), take the last
            40 characters, and prefix with 0x, give you your 42-character address.
        </p>
        <p>Private Key: You use this to send funds from an account. The secret half of your Address / public key.A string of
            64 hexadecimal characters. (Almost) every string of 64 hexadecimal characters is a private key. If you hand-type
            a private key differently today than yesterday, you will access a different wallet. Never hand type your private
            key. This is the string you need to send from your account. Without it you cannot access your funds. Although,
            you don't need to save this raw, unencrypted private key in this format. You can saving the fancy versions of
            it (e.g. the Keystore File / Mnemonic Phrase). Example: afdfd9c3d2585ef585294f6cedcae98e18dcd697e2a3521b1578140422a4f759

        <h4>Part 2: FAQ</h4>
        <p>1.Getting started？</p>
        <p>Create a new wallet
            <br> Back up the wallet
            <br> Verify you have access to this new wallet
            <br> Transfer ETH/tokens to this new wallet
            <br> Check your balance </p>
        <p>2.How to back up your wallet？</p>
        <p>Enter OCPay
            <br> Enter a strong but easy to remember password. Do not forget it.
            <br> This encrypts (protects) your private key. It does not generate your private key. This password alone will -
            Click the “Create Wallet" button.</p>
        <p>Click the “Go Backup Now” button.</p>
        <p>Download your Keystore file & save this file to a USB drive.</p>
        <p>This is the encrypted version of your private key. You need the password to access it. It is safer than your unencrypted
            private key but you must have your password to access it in the future.</p>
        <p>Print your paper wallet backup and/or carefully hand-write the private key (Mnemonic Phrase) on a piece of paper.</p>

        <p>If you are writing it, it is recommend you write it 2 or 3 times. This decreases the chance your messy handwriting
            will prevent you from accessing your wallet later.
        </p>
        <p>Copy & paste your address into a text document somewhere.
        </p>
        <p>Search your address on https://etherscan.io/. Bookmark this page. This is how you will view your balance at any time
        </p>
        <p>Send a small amount of Ether (0.0001 ETH) from your previous wallet or exchange to your new wallet.
        </p>
        <p>Unlock your new wallet from the Keystore file on your USB drive or via the private key that you printed out. Ensure
            it unlocks the wallet you are sent to and matches the bookmark you have.
        </p>
        <p>Do not simply leave your new wallet open. Pretend you are coming back a year later to access your riches.
        </p>
        <p>Send a small amount of Ether (0.00001 ETH) from this new wallet to another address.
        </p>
        <p>We are a free service. There are no fees, no ads, no tracking, no selling your data.
        </p>
        <p>Ensure you have recorded all necessary bits of information and the addresses match at all times. If they don't, you
            mis-wrote something somewhere. That means it's time to start from the beginning in order to make sure you never
            lose access to your funds.
        </p>
        <p>Doing all of this is tedious, but it ensures you (1) have complete access to your funds (2) the address you sent
            to is correct and matches the private key you have saved and (3) you can rest easily for years to come, knowing
            you will be able to access your ETH later.
        </p>
        <p> 3.What to do if you forgot your password？</p>
        <p>In order to ensure your security & privacy, no sensitive data is ever saved, stored, or transmitted when you use
            OCPay. We only have access to the information that is publicly available on the blockchain. Unfortunately, this
            means we cannot: - Recover or reset your password - Recover your private key - Reverse or cancel transactions
            - Access you account - Recover your account - Send your ETH or Tokens from one address to another
        </p>
        <p>Before using OCPay, make sure to back up Keystore and Mnemonic Phrase. In this case, you can import your wallet with
            Mnemonic Phrase and then reset the password.
        </p>
        <p>4.What to do if you lost private key?
        </p>
        <p>If you lose your mnemonic and your keystore, your crypto are all lost forever. Anyone that views and remembers mnemonic
            can take all your crypto. Never ever store this anywhere digitally.
        </p>
        <p>So the most important thing when using a decentralized wallet like OCPay is to back up your wallet. Be fucking careful
            about mnemonic and keystore. It’s your responsibility to store them securely.

        </p>
        <p>5.What to do if you sent to the wrong address？
        </p>
        <p>OCPay does not hold your ETH or tokens. We are simply an interface that allows you to easily interact with the Ethereum
            blockchain. In order to ensure your security & privacy, no sensitive data is ever saved, stored, or transmitted
            when you use OCPay. We only have access to the information that is publicly available on the blockchain. Unfortunately,
            this means we cannot: - Reverse or cancel transactions - Access you account - Recover your account - Send your
            ETH or Tokens from one address to another - Recover your private key - Recover or reset your password If the
            account belongs to someone or an exchange, you should attempt to reach out to them to find out if you can recover
            your ETH. You can see if it is an account in use by searching it on etherscan.
        </p>
        <p>6.What to do if you've been had your funds stolen? I’m really sorry, but it sounds like you may have been the victim
            of a phishing attack, malware, remote-access hack (e.g. via Teamviewer), or something similar. I cannot easily
            tell you how this could have happened without knowing what you do. Unfortunately, once a transaction is on the
            blockchain, it's final. We do what we can to warn others, or whatever we can given the particular situation.
        </p>
        <p>7.What to do if ETH or Tokens sent to or from exchange haven't shown up？ First, check the transaction on https://etherscan.io/
            and ensure that there is no red ( ! ) symbol by the transaction.
        </p>
        <p> A successful transaction will look like this:</p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xcde5a30a1a1514919e9c357d4e89211701aa22a741936ad9516c2987d8b097c9">https://etherscan.io/tx/0xcde5a30a1a1514919e9c357d4e89211701aa22a741936ad9516c2987d8b097c9</a> (!!!)</p>
        <p> And unsuccessful one will look like this:</p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf9c8514fad47eb54a414930563aabfeceb465c9f308f5f294a37edd0d669243c">https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf9c8514fad47eb54a414930563aabfeceb465c9f308f5f294a37edd0d669243c</a> (!!!)</p>
        <p>If there is no red symbol, that means the transaction is a valid & successful transaction on the blockchain. OCPay
            do not store your funds and you do not have an account with us. We do not have the ability to process withdrawals
            nor deposits, nor can we send or cancel transactions. If your funds aren't showing up where you sent them, you
            likely need to reach out to that service and for more information. We also highly recommend that you Google the
            services you send funds to as there are a lot of scams out there. Typing in "[service name] + scam" or "[service
            name] + reviews" will help you determine if you are sending to a legitimate service.</p>
