        <h3> What is a mnemonic?</h3>


        <p>
            The mnemonic is used to derive multiple private keys. It is a unique wallet phrase that gives you a human readable format
            of words to backup your wallet for recovery. It is typically a phrase that allows you to access an infinite number
            of accounts. At its purest form it is a patter of letters, words or associations that help you remember the information
            easily. It is used by Ledger, TREZOR, MetaMask, Jaxx and others.
        </p>
        <p>The accounts you can access with this phrase are determined by the "path." OCPay allows for you to import a wallet
            using the mnemonic from different paths. However, you cannot export a private key on OCPay.
